## About the Project

* This project was created to help users buy a car and allow them to budget efficiently.

## Introduction

The reason behind this project was to help buyers in purchasing a new car.  

When going to a dealership, salesmen will change numbers for their own benefit and not for the buyers. 
Too many numbers will sometimes make first buyers nervous and in some cases, agree to bad deals. 

With this program, I hope to help buyers quickly calculate an approximate monthly car note, and be witness of how much interest they are to pay for their new vehicle. 
This also, helps buyers adjust their budget with an additional car note. 

### Operating Program
To operate this program, you'll need to download Python 3.11

This is a direct link to the website: https://www.python.org/
> Please make sure to download Python (version 3.11) for your appropriate operating system. (IOS/Windows)

### Pseudocode

The following details the inputs and outputs that the program offers

### Program Details
Head to `termproject` to view the full code for this program.


To begin, the program prompts the user to input the following
* user name, car make, car model, and car year
* loan length desired
* car price and interest offered

the program then takes those inputs into account and begins the calculation for:
* the total cost of the loan
* the interest the buyer should expect to pay over the loan term 

> The interest is provided by itself to allow the buyer to view if the interest is high or a good option for them. With this, the buyer can also decided if to increse their loan term or decrease the time, and although their interest rate may also change, the buyer is fully aware of the interests expected to be paid. 

Finally the calculation is done and the total cost of the loan is divided by the desired loan length that the user input, giving them their final monthly payment.

### Future Improvements or Updates
Although I like the quick and simple way the program offers the monthly payment for the user as well as their total loan cost, I hope that in this program I can add more things such as:
* Provide users with tables that include  information regarding their cars and payments
* Compare prices amongst cars input to program and select best option 
* Select and provide best option by desired amount/budget
