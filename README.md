## About the Project

* This project was created to help users buy a car and allow them to budget efficiently. :smile:

## Introduction

The reason behind this project was to help buyers in purchasing a new car.  

When going to a dealership, salesmen will change numbers for their own benefit and not for the buyers. 
Too many numbers will sometimes make first buyers nervous and in some cases, agree to bad deals.

This also, helps buyers adjust their budget with an additional car note.
